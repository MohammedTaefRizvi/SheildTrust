**ABSTRACT**

  The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is an advanced solution designed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real time using machine learning techniques. With the increasing shift towards digital payments, 
  financial fraud has become a significant threat to banks, financial institutions, and consumers. Traditional fraud detection methods, which rely on static rule-based approaches, often struggle to adapt to new fraud patterns. 
  To address this issue, our system employs a hybrid approach combining Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection) and Logistic Regression (supervised classification) to efficiently distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. 
  The system ensures real-time fraud detection, providing instant fraud alerts, automated email notifications, and a dynamic dashboard for financial analysts to monitor suspicious activities effectively. 
  This project integrates a Django-based backend, a secure MySQL database, and a web-based user interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide seamless fraud detection capabilities. 
  The model is trained on largescale transaction datasets, utilizing feature engineering, data preprocessing, and classification algorithms to enhance detection accuracy. Security measures such s encryption, 
  authentication mechanisms, and SQL injection prevention further strengthen the system’s reliability.
  The solution is scalable and adaptable for various financial sectors, including banking, e-commerce, and online payment gateways.
